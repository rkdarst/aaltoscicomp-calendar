# yaml to calendar

See https://github.com/priyeshpatel/yaml-to-ical for formatting help.
Note that we had to make custom changes for it to work with python3,
see the rkdarst fork.

For the .ics feed that can be imported into calendars, see the github
pages site.

This is alpha-quality and is likely to need code changes to make it
work in the general case.  The upstream yaml-to-ical hasn't been
changed in seven years so definitely needs some updates and packaging.
